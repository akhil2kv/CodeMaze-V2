## Introduction
A README is like a project's front door â€“ it's the first thing users see. Let's make ours informative and engaging!

## Project Configuration
- Set up your environment for writing the README.
- All GitHub READMEs use Markdown â€“ a lightweight syntax for styling textÂ¹.
- Familiarize yourself with Markdown â€“ it's as easy as pie!

## Logging Service
- Create a custom logging service using NLog.
- Register it in the Program class.
- Use it in controllers and services.

## Onion Architecture
- Understand the layered Onion Architecture.
- Create models, repositories, and services.
- Separate core business logic from infrastructure and presentation layers.

## Handling GET Requests
- Create controllers and routes for GET requests.
- Use DTOs and AutoMapper for mapping.
- Implement content negotiation and custom formatters.

## Global Error Handling
- Handle errors globally using middleware.
- Create an ErrorDetails class.
- Test error handling with Postman.

## Content Negotiation
- Support different media types (JSON, XML, CSV).
- Use formatters for serialization and deserialization.

## Method Safety and Idempotency
- Understand safe and idempotent methods.
- Choose the right HTTP methods for your operations.

## Creating Resources
- Handle POST requests.
- Validate request models.
- Create parent and child resources.

## Working with DELETE Requests
- Implement DELETE methods.
- Delete single and parent resources.

## Working with PUT Requests
- Update resources using PUT.
- Insert resources while updating.

## Working with PATCH Requests
- Apply partial updates using PATCH.
- Use JsonPatchDocument.

## Validation
- Validate request models.
- Use built-in and custom attributes.
- Improve project documentation.

## Asynchronous Code
- Understand asynchronous programming.
- Use async/await and Task types.
- Optimize performance with asynchronous methods.

Remember, a good README not only explains your project but also helps you stand out among other developers. Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
